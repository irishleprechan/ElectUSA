# ElectUSA
 openSource OnLine Election Prototype
IEEE/ACM study concluded decade(s) before open online internet voting.

Goal is to maximize online voter input and iterate as we develop bullet-proof goals; policies; processes; procedures & audit ability.

Even if true, we need to start iterations of design & delivery & issues & problems to be overcome in process & data design of end-to-end mechanisms to ensure USA secret-ballot style anonymous vote-casting, while providing for end-to-end encryption given zero-trust of institutions under which we live.

Regardless of party-affiliation, if any, we need ALL citizens to be able to "vote" and  provide feedback to elected representatives on a variety of issues, with expressed cost-benenfit; risk; and goal-alignment prioritization combining sense of urgency and importance relative to full list of items.

Feedback solicited from constituents of elected representatives, might also be "weighted" and "scored" based on alignment to values; morals; and ethics of district represented and perhaps, knowledge; skill; expertise of constituent providing that input.

Voting Registration is a weak link, but voting districts are self-regulated, and identification and authentication mechanisms are up to each locality.  Authorization to participate in any given election is based on rule-set provided by local voting registration laws and guidelines and are normally expected to be adhered to accordingly per local jurisdiction oversight, and ballot "templates" and instances thereof, offered to registered voters in each local district accordingly if qualification satisfied.  Ballot templates will have "signature" (CRC & Hash).
Ballot template instances are numbered and offered to registered voters in bulk fashon, with "Versions" and bulk batch assigned by date.

Registered voters then obtain or are assigned ballot template instances. Casting ballots by voters means completing enough of ballot template instance with selections.  Optionally, unique ballot template instances may include, say, a number provided by voter as well as "phrase" meaningful to voter, so voter can track the cast-ballot later optionally if they wish.  

Voter registration, doesn't get cast ballot once completed, other than registration that a ballot template instance has been submitted to aggregator, signifying ballot has been cast.

Aggregator need not "know" necessarily, how to tie back a cast ballot to an indiviudual voter, just to a voting district and ballot template batch number and date/time received & processed.

Audit will be permitted only by aggregator "counting" by batch and providing back to voting district quantity of cast ballots.

Databases today can do quantitative analysis, "bean counting" without fully disclosing attribution back to individual, so no personally identifiable information must be sent to aggregator.

A voter, knowing their voting district and date/time submitted, can bracket what batch their votes may be counted in, and additionally, if they provided a number they can recollect, and a phrase they can recollect, (never provided to voting district) can call up if their vote had been captured and processed accurately by voting aggregator.  

These two "Key" values, known only to voter themselves, along with date/time ballot cast, and voting district, will allow only voter to "see" cast vote once cast and associate back to voter.

At issue, is if boss or abusive spouse/parent/child or union "oversees" cast ballot.  Designation by original voter of "multiple" authentications at voter registry, would enable voter casting "Vote that doesn't count" under their same identification ID, that might be watched by others, and later, casting with same identification ID, and other authentication, the "real" ballot.  This is similar to most home alarm systems allowing two passwords, one to use if home owner has gun to head.

"OOPS" - late detection of error in ballot template or instances of ballot template provided, could be "recalled", if voter attempts to vote again with same ID & authentication, but new ballot template/instance has  been "reissued" for voting district.  Similarly, if voter "Reconsiders" an "early vote cast", they can re identify and authenticate themselves, assuming not under duress, and modify a cast ballot should local voting district permit.

"Late Registration" - should someone "forget" to register, they should be able to get credentials to identify and authenticate themselves up to almost date of voting, provided they agree to give up "secret ballot" and provide ID Number & phrase to "recall" ballot to voter district administration, knowing they must follow-up wihtin voting district guidelines to prove self and get identification and authenntication in formal manner ASAP and face charges if in violation according to wishes of local district.

Encryption end-to-end, say as done in IBM Mainframe z/os, or other certified configurations, with end-to-end cross-cutting concerns of immutable operating system(SMF/RMF) and communication journaling(CICS) and database logging(DB2) and monitoring and verification and validation and database logging and dashboards for tallying monotonically incremental voting as they are cast are required, with failover to multi-site high availability and serviceability and reliabilty and scalability certifiable and simulated under high-interarrival rate  & volume 
testing and disaster recovery scenario testing proven ahead of time at six-sigma levels with public failure-mode-event-analysis incrementally improved upon with iterations ongoing forevermore.

Process design and data design must be pre-approved by open-source and crowd-sourced cross-cutting teams from major and minor political parties to degree reasonably agreed to ahead of elections.  In this republic, if input on bills and resolutions are voted upon by consituents, they are "non-binding" on elected representative but "tally" of deviating from wishes of constituents will be aggregated and available to a degree to be incorporated in next voting opportunity.  Scorecard of algignment to individual voter goals; objectives; barriers; constraints; priorities; cost-benefit; values; morals; ethics can be "scored" against voter's private preferences not shared with voter district registration or aggregator unless voters opt-in for thatj, to assist them in matching candidate "platform" granularity declaration and adherence of elected officials against enumerated goals, so may be easily incorporated next election cycle.

Scrubbing "voter registration" roles is a problem, and on-line "transactions" may be collected online to be fed back to voting districts to review and certify and valitate in accordance with local district set of rules & regulations for doing so

Any/all changes to this is welcome to be ammended and approved by this repository's crowdsourced/opensourced opinion leaders certified and validated as having best intererests of  USA tenets incorporated.
